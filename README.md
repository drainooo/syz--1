## read me
	so i walked and i walked
	for seven days ,straight
	scythian on the steppe
	hare, hare, ,hare srikrshna!
	to the walls of damascus
	damascus, dimashq .
	verily, i have no where to die
	and i move onâ€”
	snowblind in my heart
	centuries of calm bloodshed;
	these trees want nothing. .
	nothing.
	the winter told me this:
	"here i am for the first time
	and so i reply:,
	"thank you my love"
